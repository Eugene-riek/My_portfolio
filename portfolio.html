                They say the best doctors have healing hands, but mine found a different kind of passion - the power of technology.  I started my journey as a medical student, but the allure of web development was too strong to resist.  Fueled by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I embarked on a path of self-discovery, learning the intricacies of code.  The AMSUN code community provided invaluable support and introduced me to the PLP project, further solidifying my commitment to the world of web development.

                I'm a self-taught web developer with a strong foundation in version control using Git. I leverage my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring websites to life. But my true strength lies in my dedication -  I'm driven to produce the best possible product for my clients, ensuring their needs are not just met, but exceeded.
            </p>

                Let's build something amazing together!  I'm always eager to collaborate on new and exciting projects. Feel free to browse my portfolio or contact me to discuss your web development needs.
